  Imagine being able to define what your family stands for, create a
  beautifully designed document that you&apos;re proud to display in your
  home and referring to the document regularly as you lead your family
  toward success... …Imagine being able to share this with your
  children and make sure they understand why these things are
  important so that they can continue them even after you&apos;re gone.
  …Imagine having a place where everyone in your family can come
  together and talk about how you want to live as a family. Now
  imagine being able to do all of these things without having to spend
  hours researching and writing up each one individually by hand.
